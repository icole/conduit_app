# Push Notification Final Debug Checklist

## ✅ What's Working:
1. **Device token received** - Getting 32-byte token from iOS
2. **Token registered with Stream** - Successfully sent to Stream Chat
3. **Device appears in Stream** - 1 device registered with correct ID
4. **iOS permissions granted** - Notifications authorized

## 🔍 Critical Check: Stream Dashboard Configuration

### The Most Common Issue: APNs Environment Mismatch

Your app is running in **Production** mode:
```
📱 Environment: Production
```

This means you need **Production APNs** configured in Stream Dashboard.

### Step-by-Step Stream Dashboard Check:

1. **Go to Stream Dashboard:**
   - https://dashboard.getstream.io
   - Select your app
   - Navigate to **Chat** → **Push Notifications**

2. **Check iOS/APNs Section:**
   Look for these EXACT settings:

   **For APNs Authentication Key (.p8 file):**
   ```
   Provider Type: APNs
   Environment: ✅ Production (MUST match your build)
   Bundle ID: com.colecoding.Conduit (or your actual bundle ID)
   Team ID: [Your 10-character team ID]
   Key ID: [Your key ID from Apple]
   Provider Name: Stream-Push-Notifications
   ```

   **For APNs Certificate (.p12 file):**
   ```
   Provider Type: APNs
   Environment: ✅ Production (MUST match your build)
   Bundle ID: com.colecoding.Conduit (or your actual bundle ID)
   Certificate: [Uploaded .p12 file]
   Provider Name: Stream-Push-Notifications
   ```

3. **Common Misconfigurations:**
   - ❌ **Wrong Environment** - Using Development cert for Production build
   - ❌ **Wrong Bundle ID** - Must match exactly (case-sensitive)
   - ❌ **Expired Certificate** - Check expiration date
   - ❌ **Wrong Provider Name** - Must be "Stream-Push-Notifications"

## 🧪 Test Procedure:

### Method 1: Test with Two Accounts
1. **Your Phone:** Logged in as User ID: 2 (Carrie Cole)
2. **Web/Other Device:** Log in as DIFFERENT user (e.g., User ID: 1)
3. Put app in **background** on your phone
4. Send message from the OTHER user
5. Wait 5-10 seconds for notification

### Method 2: Stream Dashboard Test Tool
1. Go to Stream Dashboard → Push Notifications
2. Find **"Send Test Notification"** button
3. Enter your device token: `8a539d742cff531283b0314786d93b559a85d6718e27dbd3cd2d9c2aea9721e7`
4. Select correct environment (Production)
5. Send test

## 📋 Debug Commands to Run:

### In the App:
1. **Chat Tab → Debug → "Show Stream User ID"**
   - Check build configuration (DEBUG vs RELEASE)
   - Verify iOS notification settings

2. **Chat Tab → Debug → "Test Local Notification"**
   - Confirms iOS notifications work locally

### Check Stream Logs:
1. Stream Dashboard → Push Notifications → **Logs** tab
2. Look for:
   - ✅ "Notification sent successfully"
   - ❌ "Invalid device token" - Wrong environment
   - ❌ "No valid provider" - APNs not configured
   - ❌ "Device not found" - Token not registered

## 🚨 Most Likely Issues:

### Issue 1: Environment Mismatch
**Your app shows:** `Environment: Production`
**Stream Dashboard must have:** Production APNs configured

**Solution:**
- Upload Production APNs certificate/key to Stream
- OR build app in Debug mode (uses Development APNs)

### Issue 2: Testing with Same User
**You are:** User ID: 2
**You must send from:** Different user (not User ID: 2)

Stream doesn't send notifications for your own messages!

### Issue 3: APNs Not Configured
Check Stream Dashboard → Push Notifications
If iOS section is empty or shows errors:
1. Create new APNs Key in Apple Developer Portal
2. Upload to Stream with correct settings

## 🔧 Quick Fix Options:

### Option A: Switch to Development (Easier for Testing)
1. In Xcode: Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
2. Run → Info → Build Configuration → Debug
3. Clean and rebuild
4. Stream Dashboard: Configure Development APNs

### Option B: Fix Production (For Real Deployment)
1. Verify Production APNs in Stream Dashboard
2. Ensure certificate/key is for Production
3. Check bundle ID matches exactly

## 📱 What Should Happen:
1. Device registered ✅ (You have this)
2. Send message from different user
3. Stream sends to APNs
4. APNs delivers to your device
5. You see notification

## Next Steps:
1. **Check Stream Dashboard Logs** after sending test message
2. **Verify APNs environment** matches your build
3. **Test with different user account**
4. Report what you see in Stream logs

The device registration is working perfectly. The issue is almost certainly in the Stream Dashboard APNs configuration or testing methodology.
